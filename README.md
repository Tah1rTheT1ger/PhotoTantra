**PhotoTantra** is a browser extension developed to demonstrate a significant privacy vulnerability within the IIIT-Bangalore attendance system. It extracts student data, including photographs taken for attendance, from class summary pages to serve as a tangible proof-of-concept for the institute's administration.

### **NOTICE: Ethical Use Mandate**

This tool's function is to prove a fundamental failure in the privacy and security of the attendance system. It demonstrates unauthorized access to student biometric data (photographs) collected without adequate protection.

Its existence is a direct appeal to the administration to address this critical issue.

**Any use of this tool or the data it exposes for purposes other than this demonstration is an ethical violation and is strictly prohibited. Handle this information responsibly.**
